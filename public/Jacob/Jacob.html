      <h2>My favourite software</h2>
      <p>My favorite program is a chess engine called AlphaZero. Developed by google in the mid 2010's, it was built differently to the typical chess engine. Instead of programming in pattern detection and a library of human games to extrapolate winning strategies from, AlphaZero played billions of games against itself, until it could no longer improve. This gives AlphaZero a beautifully aggressive style where it will often sacrifice multiple pieces/pawns for iniatitive and board control.</p>
